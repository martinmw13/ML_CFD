# ML_CFD

This repository contains the code developed for my thesis for the Nuclear Engineering degree. PCA, Manifold Learning techniques, and deep Autoencoders are applied for dimensionality reduction regarding Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.

The repository also includes the manuscript of the thesis for further reference.

The CFD data is not uploaded for size reasons. If needed, contact me at martin.madrid@ib.edu.ar.
