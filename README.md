# ML_CFD
This repository contains the code developed for my thesis for the Nuclear Engineering degree. PCA, Manifold Learning techniques, and deep Autoencoders are applied for dimensionality reduction regarding Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.

The CFD data is not uploaded for size matters, if needed, contact me at martin.madrid@ib.edu.ar.
